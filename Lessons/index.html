        Angular and Bootstrap are powerful foundation for building responsive single page web applications.
        <br />Modern web applications built on this foundation can be easily transformed into high quality mobile applications.
        <br />In these lessons we introduce key concepts from Bootstrap and Angular.
        <br />And we try to keep each small, with just a few new concepts in each so it is easy to see how everything fits together.
