      Angular and Bootstrap provide a solid foundation for building modern, responsive, single-page web applications.
      And with the Web Application Template (WAT), such applications can be easily transformed into high quality mobile applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      This powerful set of capabilities enables developers to quickly create high-quality solutions that run on the web and on all major devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help developers get up to speed on this approach, the follow lessons introduce some key concepts from Bootstrap and Angular.
      And we keep each lesson small, with just a few new concepts in each, so it is easy to see how everything fits together.
